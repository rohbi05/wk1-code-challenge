## student grade generator
  I am required to create a grade generator that a user to enter marks and calculates the grade scored using the following system

* 80-100   -> A 
* 60-79    -> B
* 50-69    -> C
* 40-49    -> D
* Below 40 -> E
  
   I included a readline to prompt  an input Question;
      "enter student marks'
  After student keys in the score  it is generated and    the respective grade
  and displays it as
  "your grade is (grade)"
  if the score keyed in is  < O || >100 || Not a Number
   the function returns "Please enter a valid grade"
